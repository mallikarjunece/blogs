Sometimes we have to comment multiple lines of code with this editor. 
this is a simple way to do it:

1) Position yourself at the beginning of the first line of the block you want to comment.
2) Press Ctrl + V: visual mode
3) Get down the cursor to the last line of the block you want to comment.
4) Ctrl + I: Insert
5) #
6) Press Esc twice

Another way:

:x,y s/^/## /

where:

'x' and 'y' are the initial and final line that we want to comment.


Example:

:1,10 s/^/# / 


Will comment the lines from 1 to 10.
