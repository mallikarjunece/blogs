Other names that have been reported to cause trouble:

* accept
* callback – breaks validation if used as a model method.
* categorie
* action
* attributes – if you have a has_many called attributes, you can’t access to your object attributes anymore; only the associated objects
* application2
* @base_path – setting this variable name in a controller method seems to break the ablity to render a partial in the view. The view will render with no content and no errors will be generated .
* connection – there seems to be a connection class already
* database – (in mysql)
* dispatcher
* display1
* drive – fixtures will not autogenerate IDs in Rails 2.0.2
* errors
* format
* host – I had a text_field :host, :name that I saw problems with. (JR)
* key
* layout – If you have a model called Layout and in a controller have “scaffold :layout” it generates an exception. However, if you script/generate the scaffold for layout it works.
* load – When making an Ajax call to an action named load, the action’s code will be skipped (or otherwise rendered useless). This is made apparent by: a) @variables are not available in the view, b) calling render :layout => false still yields the layout.
* link – breaks migrations when used as a column name in combination with validation: ticket
* new, override to news if you want a news table
* notify – not a valid column name
* open – not a valid column name
* public
* quote ‘quote’ cannot be used as a column name
* render – cannot be used as an action name
* request
* records – a table named records seemed to cause duplicate entries to be found by find
* responses – scaffold borks with "undefined method ‘body=’ "
* save – ActiveRecord uses this to save the object.
* scope – do not use as an association name because ActiveRecord::Base.scope is called instead
* send
* session (session_controller or SessionController will not work)
* system – a table column named system causes problems when trying to generate scaffold
* template – a table named templates causes an error when you try to invoke the create method of the default controller
* test (however those work with ruby test/unit/axistest.rb_ and rake testunits_)
* timeout – an ActiveRecord attribute named timeout will clash with the global function “timeout” defined in Ruby’s timeout.rb
* to_s — naming a model instance method to_s resulted in ‘File not found’ for any view an object of this class (should have) appeared in (no matter which method called) and WebRick had to be restarted. I couldn’t drag the very cause into light, but in the traces ‘to_s’ gave me a hint. After renaming everything worked well again.
* type — or any of the other MagicFieldNames
* URI
* visits — a table column named visits causes problems when trying to query some_obj.visits.
* Observer — for a model name works in development environment but not in production.
singular names finishing in “s”: Axis → Axes, Access → Accesses, will break the pluralization in rake: Axi, Acces

Monitor cannot be used. It is a Ruby class that is related to threading.
